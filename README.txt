this is a copy of ffi generated "darwin-ios" source  
based on the effort of official and ksjogo (github id)

======================================

with the source files, you can easily build dynamic or static library

this is also a cocoapods wrapper for ffi, usage example:
pod 'ffi-ios', :git => 'https://github.com/stephenwzl/ffi-ios.git', :branch => 'master'

in this pod, compile flags was set to '-w' default, because of many disturbing warnings that i can't fix
but linker warnings can't be closed

this pod test passed with NVMAspects and JSPatch
